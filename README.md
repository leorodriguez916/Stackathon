# Armor Up!

## About

Armor Up! is a fast-paced 2D game that allows players ages 12+ to hone the speed of their reactions through quick, interactive math problems.

The game offers the player only one choice each round: an item which will reduce incoming damage by a flat amount, or an item which will reduce damage by a percentage value. Simple! As the game speeds up, the player must be quick on their feet to select the right option judging on what kind of enemies are approaching.

## Customize

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

- Update project name and description in `package.json`
- `npm install`
- Create two postgres databases (`MY_APP_NAME` should match the `name`
  parameter in `package.json`):
- These commands will create both your **development** and **test** databases

```
createdb <YOUR APP NAME HERE FROM package.json>
createdb <YOUR APP NAME HERE FROM package.json>-test
```

- By default, running `npm test` will use your test database, while
  regular development uses development database

## Start

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)

### Heroku

1.  Set up the [Heroku command line tools][heroku-cli]
2.  `heroku login`
3.  Add a git remote for heroku:

[heroku-cli]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

- **If you are creating a new app...**

  1.  `heroku create` or `heroku create your-app-name` if you have a
      name in mind.
  2.  `heroku config:set JWT=<your secret here!>` to set a secret for JWT signing

Database Setup

3.  `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to add
    ("provision") a postgres database to your heroku dyno (This creates your production database)

4.  `heroku config:set SEED=true` to get heroku to sync and seed your database

5.  note everytime your app restarts, the database tables will be dropped and re-created. To avoid this you can `config:unset SEED`

- **If you already have a Heroku app...**

  1.  `heroku git:remote your-app-name` You'll need to be a
      collaborator on the app.

Now, you should be deployed!
